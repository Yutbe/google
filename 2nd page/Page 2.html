		Look towards the night sky<br>
		It shines the light of a billion lights<br>
		But my life was dark and uninterresting<br>
		Until my eyes met towards the one star that shines my path at night<br>
		<br>
		Look towards the night sky<br>
		Out the window, out there one of those beacon of light bare your name now<br>
		and with it a question<br>
		from me<br>
		Sam<br>
